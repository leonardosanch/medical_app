## Tips for Better Results

### For Voice Recognition

- Speak at a normal pace, not too fast
- Use a quality microphone when possible
- Reduce background noise
- Clearly articulate medical terms
- Take brief pauses between sentences

### For Medical Translation

- Use standard medical terms whenever possible
- Review the translation for critical terms before communicating it
- For highly specialized terminology, provide additional context
- The application is optimized for common medical terminology; highly specialized terms may require verification

## Common Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working

1. Ensure you have granted microphone permissions to the browser
2. Check that your microphone is working correctly
3. Some browsers have better support for voice recognition (Chrome and Edge are recommended)

### Translation Seems Inaccurate

1. Check that you have selected the correct languages
2. Try being more specific and using complete sentences
3. For complex medical terms, verify the translation with a medical dictionary

### Audio Not Playing

1. Ensure your device's volume is turned on
2. Some browsers have better support for speech synthesis
3. If browser audio fails, the app will attempt to use the backend service

### Application Feels Slow

1. The first translations may be slower as models load
2. Slow internet connections can affect performance
3. On mobile devices with limited resources, performance may be lower

## Privacy & Security

- The application does not permanently store your conversations or translations
- Data is processed locally whenever possible
- Transcriptions and translations are securely transmitted to the server
- Audio files are temporarily stored and deleted after processing

## Current Limitations

- Supports six major languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Italian)
- Some highly specialized medical terms may not be translated perfectly
- Voice recognition accuracy may vary based on accent and microphone quality
- The application requires an internet connection for most functionalities

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use the app without an internet connection?**  
A: The app requires an internet connection to function properly, as it relies on backend services for translations and some voice processing.

A: The app is designed with privacy in mind, but for highly sensitive information, it is recommended to use certified medical services compliant with HIPAA or similar regulations.

**Q: How accurate is the medical translation?**  
A: The app is optimized for common medical terminology and provides better accuracy than general translators. However, for critical medical communications, it is always recommended to verify with a professional medical interpreter.
